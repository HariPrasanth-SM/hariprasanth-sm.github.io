### Research Focus

My research explores the integration of robotics into industrial environments to automate various processes. The goal is to develop advanced research-driven solutions that address real-world challenges faced by industries.

**Research Interests:**
- Sensor Fusion
- Indoor Mobile Robots 
- Deep Learning

### Current Projects

**PFICE: A Method to Estimate Uncertainty of Scan-Matching to Enhance Indoor Robot Localization**  
- This research aims to enable reliable localization by quantifying the uncertainty in lidar scan-matching through the comparison of solid planar features between the map and the current scan.  
- Localization, Scan-matching, Uncertainty Estimation  
- Preliminary results show improved accuracy in environments with dynamic objects, compared to a standard EKF-based localization system.

**Few-shot Object Detection Using Vision Foundation Models for Industrial Objects**  
- This project focuses on developing an object detection system using vision foundation models for industrial objects where training data is limited.  
- Object Detection, Foundation Models
